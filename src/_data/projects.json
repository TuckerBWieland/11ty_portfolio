            "narrative": "At Justworks, we had a strange challenge: customers loved us, but too few people had heard of us. That lack of awareness was slowing down sales, even though our product stood out in the market. To fix it, we dug into research with agencies to figure out how to break through the noise, then tied those insights to our ideal customer profile work. The result was a coordinated awareness push: TV spots, digital ads, and out-of-home campaigns that all carried the same clear message through the sales funnel. As Strategy & Ops lead, I managed the strategy, budget, and cross-team coordination to keep everything on track. The outcome: stronger brand awareness and more efficient campaigns, with clear gains in reaching the right buyers. <a href='https://adage.com/creativity/work/aa-justworks-for-your-people/' target='_blank' class='text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 underline'>Read more about the campaign in Ad Age</a>."

            "narrative": "When I joined Justworks, marketing spend was stuck at ~7% of revenue. Leadership didn't trust the ROI numbers, so they were hesitant to invest, even in areas with real growth potential. Over the next few years, I worked across revenue enablement, BI, analytics, marketing ops, and product to rebuild how we measured impact. We aligned data, built reliable reporting, and tied marketing activity directly to business results. That transparency changed the conversation. Executives saw that marketing could deliver returns and spend responsibly, which unlocked more budget each year. Today, marketing investment has nearly doubled to ~14% of revenue and is recognized as a proven growth driver with a scalable foundation for the future."

Roadmaps and reports existed, but they were scattered and hard to piece together. After trying just about every project management tool and finding them bloated, a teammate and I built our own. It was a simple Slack-based system backed by GCP: lightweight reminders and org chart context nudged teams to update projects regularly, and the data rolled up into a format everyone could use. The results were immediate. Over 80% of projects stayed current within 14 days, leadership finally had visibility into where energy was going, and course corrections got faster. What started as a side project turned into an adopted tool that made the whole company more aligned."

At Shopify, we embraced that by launching the Dev Degree Program: a partnership with universities that sponsored computer science students, blending their studies with real-world development experience at Shopify. This approach built genuine trust. Students became natural advocates, and Shopify earned credibility in the developer community. The program quickly gained momentum—praised by our CTO and CEO, attracting thousands of applicants each year, and sparking lively conversation on Reddit and Discord. As Marketing Lead, I secured funding, aligned stakeholders, and worked closely with university partners to bring the program to life.

The problem was, building a new course took a ton of time and money—so launching the wrong thing wasn't an option. What we lacked was a reliable way to determine ahead of time whether people actually wanted what we were about to build. A few of us decided to tackle that, and we ended up creating GA's first growth team. The idea we landed on was surprisingly simple: make our roadmap public. We shared the course topics we were considering and invited students, alumni, and industry folks to weigh in. Suddenly, we had a real feedback loop. Instead of guessing, we could see demand directly and use it to prioritize. The results were immediate. Courses launched to build in demand, marketing had ready-made audiences, and we stopped wasting effort on ideas that would have flopped. As Senior Product Manager, I helped shape the strategy, gathered input from across the company, and implemented the system—turning an experiment into a reliable way to grow."

To make it more accessible, I built a lightweight web app as a side project. By mapping the data with GeoJSON, users could see readings in their geographic context—spotting trends, identifying problem areas, and getting a clearer picture of the harbor's health. I designed, built, and deployed the app on GitHub Pages, and it quickly resonated with volunteers and community members. People said it made the data easier to understand and gave them a stronger connection to why the harbor's health matters. <a href='https://tuckerbwieland.github.io/nyc-water-app/' target='_blank' class='text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 underline'>View the live NYC Water Quality App</a>."
