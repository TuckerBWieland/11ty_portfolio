                                I work with organizations at all stages that are rich in ideas but stuck in execution.
                                With a background that spans scrappy startups and scaled SaaS platforms, I've learned
                                how to bring order to the mess.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whether it's clarifying the plan, fixing the system, or building tools that make
                                everything run smoother â€” I show up to unlock progress.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My skills live at the intersection of strategy, operations, and innovation. I've built a
                                career on making sure good ideas don't get lost in the chaos.
